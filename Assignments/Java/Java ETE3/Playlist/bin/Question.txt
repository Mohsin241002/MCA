Playlist
Create a program that implements a playlist of songs.
to start off, implement the following classes .

1.Album 
it has three fields, two strings called name and artist and an arraylist that holds objects of type Songs called songs.
- A constructor that accepts two strings (name of the album and artist). It initiates the fields and instantiates songs.
- And three methods, they are:
    -addsong(), has tow paramenters of type string(titleof song), double(duration of song) and returns a boolean. Returns true if the song was added successfully or false otherwise.
    -findsong() has one parameter of type string(title of song) and returns a song. Returns the song if it exist, null if it doesnt exist.
    -addToPlayList() has two paramenters of type int(track number of song in album) and LinkedlIst (the playlist) that holds objects of type Song and returns a boolean. Returns true if it exists and it was added successfully using the track number or false otherwise.

2.Song
-It has two fields, s sting called title and a double called duration.
- A constructor that accepts a string (title of the song) and a double (duration of the song ). It initialises the tile and duration
- And two methods, they are:
    -getTitle(), getter for title.
    -toString() songs overriding toString method. returns a String in the following format: "title: Duration"

TIP: In Album, use the findsong() method in addSong() and addToPlayList(string, Linkedlist) to check if a song exist before proceeding.
TIP: BE extremely careful with the spelling of the names of the fields, constructors and methods.
TIP: be extremely careful about spaces and spelling in the returned string from the toSting() method.

NOTE: All fields are Private.
NOTE: All constructors are public.
NOTE: All methods are public(except for findSong() which is private)
NOTE: There are no static members.
NOTE: Classes that are not in the java.lang package should be manually imported.
NOTE: If you get and error from the
